    <h1>Indentured servants</h1>
    <p>Indentured servants were individuals who signed a contract agreeing to work for a specific number of years in exchange for passage to the New World, along with food, shelter, and other necessities. This system played a crucial role in the labor dynamics of early colonial America, influencing social structures and economic development. In the early formation of the colonies, indetured servants were the primary means of cheap labor. Most indentured servants were young Europeans, often from poor backgrounds, who sought better opportunities in America. The decline of indentured servitude was influenced by the increasing availability of African slaves, which offered a different and more permanent labor solution for plantation owners. Also indesntured servant revolts. Indentured servants faced harsh conditions, and many did not survive their terms due to disease, overwork, or mistreatment. 😞</p>
