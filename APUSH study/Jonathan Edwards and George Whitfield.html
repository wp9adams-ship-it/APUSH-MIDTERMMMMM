    <h1>Jonathan Edwards and George Whitfield</h1>
    <p>Jonathan Edwards and George Whitfield were both central figures in the FIRST GREAT AWAKENING, a religious revival emphasizing emotional conversion and it created branches of the church such as the methodists and the baptists. Edwards wrote a famous ermon called "sinners in the hands of an anrgy god". Whitefield was a oreacher who drew massive crowds and traveled along the colonies. This created a shared colonial experience that would further unite the colonies. It also led to splits like the old (didnt like the reform) and new lights (liked reform). Occurred alongside the Enlightenment, influencing views on liberty and dissent.</p>
