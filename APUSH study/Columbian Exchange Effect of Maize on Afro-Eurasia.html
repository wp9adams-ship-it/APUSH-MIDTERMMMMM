    <h1>Columbian Exchange: Effect of Maize on Afro-Eurasia</h1>
    <p>The <a href="Columbian Exchange.html"><strong>Columbian Exchange</strong></a> was the exchange of goods such as plants, animals, diseases, people, culture, technology, and more between the old and the new world. Maize(corn) was one of the most significant crops as it led to a massive population growth within the Native community allowing them to build structured and sophisticated societies.

More food leads to a greater population which leads to a larger labor force which leads to more specialized labor and different types of labor, some relating to art. Societies that adopted Maize typically also became permanent settlements instead of being hunter-gatherers who were constantly changing living locations.
