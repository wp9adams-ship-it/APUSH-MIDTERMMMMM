    <h1>Committees of Correspondence</h1>
    <p>The Committee of Correspondence was a network of communication established among the American colonies in the early 1770s to coordinate responses to British policies and promote resistance against taxation without representation. These committees played a crucial role in uniting the colonies by sharing information and mobilizing public opinion against British rule, laying the groundwork for future revolutionary actions. The first Committee of Correspondence was formed in Massachusetts in 1772, led by Samuel Adams to facilitate communication regarding British actions and promote colonial unity. By 1774, nearly all colonies had established their own Committees of Correspondence, creating a widespread network that helped organize events like the Continental Congress. These committees were instrumental in spreading revolutionary ideas and creating a shared identity.</p>
