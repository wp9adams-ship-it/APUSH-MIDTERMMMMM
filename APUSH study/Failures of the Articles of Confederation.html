    <h1>Failures of the Articles of Confederation</h1>
    <p>1. With the Articles of Confederation, the continental congress had to ask each state for money, and they could not enforce a tax on a state or an individual.  Most states would ignore this request which meant that the government had little money and would only go further in debt, The Constitution fixed this by saying that the federal government has the right to tax in order to pay for the government. This was a huge improvement because it allowed the federal government to raise money for basic needs such as raising a military.<br><br>2.  The AoC had to ask states to send them troops and sailors if an emergency like Shay’s rebellion happened or if another war broke out. Many states ignored requests for more troops which led to a lack of enforcing laws. Also, with Shay’s rebellion, it was very difficult for the rebellion to be put down because it took a while for a militia to be sent. The constitution fixed this by being able to make an army. This was significant because it gave the federal government the power to raise and maintain an army instead of relying on voluntary troops. By allowing the federal government to create its own standing army, the Constitution ensured faster, more reliable responses to rebellions, invasions, and national crises. This made the government stronger and more able to protect citizens.<br><br>3. With the AoC the government was unable to regulate the printing of money. This caused an excess amount of money being printed, which increased inflation and thus made the currency worthless. The Constitution fixed this by having the federal government regulate the currency compared to the states. This regulation was very important because this made trade between states easier, and it made it, so businesses could trust the value of the currency.</p>
